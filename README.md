# LazypigTBC

LazyPig is a WoW addon that originated in the vanilla (1.x) version of the game and features a series of small Quality of Life improvements such as loot automation, battleground automation, group invitations, chat filters, salvation removing and several other things.

This is a repository for the migration of Lazypig to the TBC (2.4.3) version of WoW, created by Flierr (Premonition) of the Feenix Archangel server.

Current state: Testing. The addon still spawns a number of errors in some of the features. I recommend disabling the improved right click feature.
